          This was the first photo I ever took of Daisy. I had a freind drive it
          to the gas station due to my lack of a license, also a memory I had
          was only spending 40 bucks to fill up lol!

          This is when I installed my favorite set of wheels. Daisy was more
          than just a car to me.
