          This was the first photo I ever took of Daisy. I had a friend drive it
          to the gas station due to my lack of a license. Also, I remember only
          spending 40 bucks to fill up—such a memory!

        <p>
          This is when I installed my favorite set of wheels. Daisy was more
          than just a car to me.

          My first real road trip with her—I remember being so happy; I didn't
          mind filling up twice.

        <p>
          Exhaust, exhaust! I remember wanting a loud car so badly, but I didn’t
          want it to be annoyingly loud, so I spent the extra coin.

        <p>
          I purchased a fancy camera to get better pics of her, but sadly didn’t
          get too many before the accident.

          The accident occurred on a rainy evening when I lost control of the
          car. Despite trying to regain control, I ended up sliding off the
          road...
